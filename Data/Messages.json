To those of you who provided your input, thank you!  Based on your feedback, we’ve adjusted our approach to better address the needs of both IT admins and end users within organizations.  We’re making the following changes to our plan:<p></p>\n<li>On November 19th, we will provide IT admins a way to turn off self-service purchasing on a per product basis via PowerShell.  More details will be forthcoming.</li> \n<li>To provide more time to prepare for this change, we are updating the launch for self-service purchase capabilities for Power Platform products to start with Power BI on January 14, 2020 for all commercial cloud customers.</li>  \n<p>Thank you again for taking the time to provide your feedback. We look forward to a continued partnership to help empower organizations to achieve more.</p>\n------\n<p>This post has been updated to include a link to FAQs under Additional Information.</p>\n\nSelf-service purchase capabilities for Power Platform products (Power BI, PowerApps, and Flow) will be available for commercial cloud customers starting 11/19.\n\n<p>Today, individuals within your organization are unable to purchase subscriptions or assign licenses for themselves or their departments without contacting you, their admin. Based on customer demand, we’ll soon be enabling self-service purchase and license management capabilities, which will allow users within your organization to purchase products directly, starting with the Power Platform family of products: Power BI, PowerApps, and Flow.</p>  \n\n<b>What is the roll-out schedule?</b> \n\n<p>Power BI will be available for self-service purchase in the US starting November 19, followed by PowerApps and Flow and additional geographies beginning December 4. This capability will not be available for customers who are eligible for Government, Nonprofit or Education offers.</p> \n\n[How does this affect me?] \n\nAs an admin, you will have a view of all self-service purchases within your tenant. You will also be able to see how many licenses users have purchased and which Azure Active Directory enabled users those licenses have been assigned to. \n\n<p>This view will only be available in the new admin center.

While Microsoft will not take any measures to block users with this configuration from connecting to Office 365 services, Office 365 ProPlus on Windows Server 2012/R2 will not be a supported configuration.

Microsoft Support will continue to accept calls from customers, however we may not be able to resolve issues that arise if those issues are determined to be unique to this configuration.</p><p>[What do I need to do to prepare for this change?]</p><p>For customers on Windows 7, we recommend that organizations migrate to Windows 10 or a supported operating system before the end of support date on January 14, 2020 in order to continue receiving new feature updates to Office 365 ProPlus.

We’ve confirmed that some users would have also seen additional impact to ancillary services with dependencies on SharePoint Online, such as PowerApps, PowerAutomate, OneDrive Sync, Word, Excel, OneNote, Teams, and background applications.\n\nDuring periods of impact, users may have experienced latency when accessing OneDrive files or receive a “503 Service Unavailable” or “Server busy” message from SharePoint.\n\nWhile our throttles were in place, users may have experienced problems when performing migrations, OneDrive for Business syncs, OneNote syncs and large file uploads.\n\nFinal status: We've successfully removed the remaining throttles on the service and confirmed after an extended period of monitoring that the service remains stable and the issue is resolved.\n\nScope of impact: This issue intermittently affected users attempting to access SharePoint Online sites and OneDrive files.\n\nStart time: Monday, December 2, 2019, at 4:00 AM UTC\n\nEnd time: Tuesday, December 10, 2019, at 9:00 PM UTC\n\nPreliminary root cause: A configuration change to the SharePoint Online caching infrastructure led to increased failure rates and latency for user request traffic into SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business. An additional layer of impact also occurred once service throttles were reduced for request traffic which accumulated during the periods of impact.\n\nNext steps:\n-We're reviewing the recent configuration change made to the SharePoint Online caching infrastructure to determine methods to prevent similar events in the future.\n-We're continuing our optimization efforts to increase efficiency of the service to prevent similar impact for future events.\n\nWe'll publish a preliminary post-incident report within the next 48 hours and a final document within the next 5 business days.","PublishedTime":"2019-12-10T23:50:27.073Z"},{"MessageText":"A post-incident report has been published.","PublishedTime":"2019-12-13T02:23:05.023Z"}],"PostIncidentDocumentUrl":"https://office365servicecomms-prod.cloudapp.net/api/v1.0/d46a7f6e-a975-4a1d-85c8-6782cd550e0e/ServiceComms/PostIncident/Health.IncidentReportDocument(incidentId='SP197263')","Severity":"Sev2","StartTime":"2019-12-02T04:00:00Z","Title":"Can't access sites","ActionRequiredByDate":null,"AnnouncementId":null,"Category":null,"MessageTagNames":null,"ExternalLink":null,"IsDismissed":null,"IsRead":null,"IsMajorChange":null,"PreviewDuration":null,"AppliesTo":null,"MilestoneDate":null,"Milestone":null,"BlogLink":null,"HelpLink":null,"FlightName":null,"FeatureName":null,"BatchNumber":0},{"AffectedWorkloadDisplayNames":[],"AffectedWorkloadNames":[],"Status":"Service restored","Workload":"SharePoint","WorkloadDisplayName":"SharePoint Online","ActionType":null,"AffectedTenantCount":0,"AffectedUserCount":null,"Classification":"Incident","EndTime":"2019-12-11T02:03:00Z","Feature":"spofeatures","FeatureDisplayName":"SharePoint Features","UserFunctionalImpact":"","Id":"SP197831","id":"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000","ImpactDescription":"Users may have experienced intermittent delays or navigation errors when accessing SharePoint sites.","LastUpdatedTime":"2019-12-11T02:28:21.153Z","MessageType":"Incident","Messages":[{"MessageText":"Title: Delays or problems loading SharePoint Online sites\r\n\r\nUser impact: Users may experience intermittent delays or navigation errors when accessing SharePoint sites.\r\n\r\nCurrent Status: We're investigating a potential issue and checking for impact to your organization.
